E-TUTION BD

What is the Project?

The Tuition Management System is a complete platform where students, tutors, and admins can manage tuition activities including tuition posting, tutor applications, financial tracking, payments, and student–tutor communication.


Why Should We Develop This Project?
●	To solve the real problem of finding qualified tutors and verified tuition.

●	To reduce friction between students and tutors by providing automated workflows.

●	To enable digital class tracking, transparent payment, and structured communication.

●	To assist admins in monitoring and regulating all platform activities.



How the System Works (Workflow)
1.	User (Student) registers and posts a tuition requirement (class, budget, location, subject, schedule, etc.).

2.	Tutors browse available tuition posts and apply to suitable tuitions.

3.	Admin reviews applications, verifies tutors, and approves or rejects tuition posts.

4.	Admin monitors the system, handles disputes, manages data, and oversees platform performance.
